# Wyvri Web Application
My attempt to make a webapp for wyvri.com

## How to Run:
`python manage.py runserver`

## How to Deploy:
1. Commit and push locally
2. Log in to pythonanywhere and pick wyvri_com
3. Open a bash console
4. git pull
5. If it opens the merge message window, hit 'esc', type ':wq' and then hit 'enter.'
6. In another pythonanywhere tab, reload the webapp
